# doodles

We, the Harvey Core Team, have been doing something very similar to [Google Doodles](http://www.google.com/doodles/). A common thing we do is to put on hats to Harvey like we did for @keef's birthday

or the St. Patrick's day one

You can submit your ideas via a pull request to this repo with the month as folder and day as the file name format, for instance St. Patrick's day march 17 becomes `03/17.png` or may the forth for Star Wars day would be `05/04.png`.

We will only accept geeky and/or goofy doodles related to Harvey. Stay clear off religious and national holidays.
