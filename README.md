# doodles

We, the Harvey Core Team, have been doing something very similar to [Google Doodles](http://www.google.com/doodles/). A common thing we do is to put on hats to Harvey like we did for @keef's birthday

or the St. Patrick's day one

You can submit your ideas via a pull request to this repo. Please have your submissions follow this naming convention:

- ```<PUBLICATION_MONTH>/<PUBLICATION_DAY>-harvey-<DAY_NAME>.ext```

For instance St. Patrick's day march 17 becomes `03/17-harvey-st-patrick.png` or may the forth for Star Wars day would be `05/04-harvey-star-wars.png`.

The image dimensions are relatively flexible, but 350x330px makes for a sensible default.

We will only accept geeky and/or goofy doodles related to Harvey. Stay clear off religious and national holidays.
